theme_agile is now updated in response to some of the feedback after I put it on GitHub a week ago.

1. I have switched from . to _ in the theme options to be consistent. Having base_size and plot.type was probably confusing.

2. The base fone size has been switched to 11 to match the default ggplot2 size.

3. I have added in an option (grid_thick) to make grid lines thinner or thicker.
